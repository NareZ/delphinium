	    Blue and purple irises symbolize wisdom. The Iris widget attempts to actualize the gamification principle of autonomy by freeing up the sequence in which students are able to approach course content. Traditional courses require that students progress through content in a linier fashion, completing one assignment after another in a fixed sequence. Iris on the other hand allows the instructor to create a hierarchy of content governed by content prerequisites. Students are then able to progress through the content in any path that feels appropriate to them, as long as prerequisites have been met.
	</p>
	<p>
	    This version of the Iris widget is an alpha stage proof-of-concept for Project Delphinium. The basic interface is complete but it is pulling from static data and its style sheets are a work in progress. It does represent, however, the first functioning widget hosted in Greenhouse, Project Delphinium's backend interface, and served up in a flexible template.
